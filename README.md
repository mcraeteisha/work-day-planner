# work-day-planner
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

When it comes to setting and achieving your goals, time management is essential. This simple work day planner will help you organize your daily tasks. List a description for your task in the text area that is provided for each hour of a standard 9-5 workday. When you click the save button, your task will be saved so that, once you refresh your page, your tasks are still available to see. Events that are in the past will display in grey. Events that are happening the current hour will display as red. Events in the future will display as green.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Momemnt.js
* Bootstrap
 
## Work Completed

To complete this project, I used the starter code provided (including an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file) to build a simple yet functional online planner.

Using VS Code, I completed the following:

* Created an HTML page to display elements created with JavaScript and jQuery.
* Created a CSS file. This project utlizes some Bootstrap features and a Font Awesome library, in addition to custom CSS styling.
* Created a JavaScript file, where jQuery and Moment.js are utilized.

## Learnings
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings Iâ€™m taking away from this project are:
1. Take time to familiarize yourself with the code that is provided. When I initially started this assignment, I wanted to dynamically display the time block, textarea, and button elements to the page. When I experienced difficulties getting that to work, I decided to display those time blocks to the page via the HTML file. The comment provided (Timeblocks go here!) would have helped me realize that displaying these elements to the page via HTML was the better option. However, I did not pay attention to that comment when I initially began my work.
2. A better understanding of how to loop over items using jQuery.
3. How to incorporate libraries such as Font Awesome when buildin and styling pages.
4. I tend to get excited when starting a new project and want to dive in and immediately start putting things on the page. But, I've found that stepping away from the computer and writing my code out by hand, and thinking about how I want a page to function has proven to be the better method of getting work done. 

## Future Application Updates
